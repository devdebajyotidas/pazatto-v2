                <h3>SSOID Service, Participating Platforms</h3>
                Pazatto’s SSOID service offers You the convenience, after a one-time registration any Pazatto Platform, to
                sign on (log in) to all web pages and online platforms operated by Pazatto or its affiliates (hereinafter
                the Participating Platforms) with single log-in access / data, without going through a separate
                registration process every time. After successfully registering for the SSOID Service, the user can
                log-in via each Participating Platform with his SSOID access credentials. Moreover, if already logged in
                to one of the Participating Platforms, the user can immediately use all other Participating Platforms
                without additional log-in procedures (subject to the respective Participating Platform requiring further
                declarations).

                The Participating Platforms that offer the SSOID as a login feature, are visible on registration and in
                the user account. The number of Participating Platforms may also vary in the course of time.

                With regard to the contractual relationships of the users with the respective Participating Platforms,
                for the purposes of which Pazatto’s SSOID service is or can be used in accordance with these T&amp;Cs,
                these can alternatively have their own commercial and user terms and conditions. These business or user
                terms and conditions are available on the respective Participating Platforms. For the respective
                contents of the Participating Platforms, the respective affiliate of Pazatto is solely responsible only
                for those content that it actually operates. For the SSOID service, these T&amp;Cs apply exclusively,
                whereas for the use of the Participating Platforms, their business and user terms and conditions apply
                along with these T&amp;Cs. The SSOID shall be owned and operated by One97 for use on all Participating
                Platforms, by One97 or its affiliates.

                For the use of Pazatto’s SSOID service, the user must register. Registration as a user is only allowed if
                the user meets the eligibility criteria as set out in these T&amp;Cs. Each user can set up only one user
                account. The user is obliged to provide correct and complete information during the registration and use
                of the SSOID service.

                The login data is intended solely for personal use by the user and therefore always to be kept secret
                and safe. The user is not entitled to share his login details with third parties to use the SSOID
                service or to disclose them otherwise. The user is obliged to inform Pazatto immediately on becoming aware
                of and/or suspecting a case of any unauthorized use, disclosure and/or misuse of their access data or of
                their user account. Furthermore, the user is obliged not to use the user account of another person.

                Submission of the duly completed registration form by the user simply provides invitation to us to make
                an offer to enter into the agreement on the use of our SSOID service (hereinafter the SSOID Agreement).
                Our offer for the conclusion of the SSOID Agreement is then effected by the fact that Pazatto sends the
                user a confirmation by e mail, in which a confirmation link is included next to the user name and the
                password for the SSOID Service. By the user clicking on this confirmation link, the user accepts Pazatto’s
                offer, so that in this way the SSOID Agreement enters into force. Conclusion of the SSOID Agreement may,
                also be effected through other communication modes and following such processes which help achieve the
                same purpose as the aforementioned e-mail confirmation process.

                Pazatto is entitled to reject individual users without giving reasons.

                The user guarantees that the data submitted for their user account (and any other information that is
                otherwise left for Pazatto) are in all respects complete, true, accurate and not misleading. Any changes
                to user’s data should be promptly updated correctly in its account.
                <h3>Communication Policy</h3>

                        only if the e-mail servers and e-mail ids are functional, and in case of push notifications, if

                        if the e-mail servers or ids are not functional or if the push-notifications feature has been
                        turned off, then You may not get the alert at all or get delayed messages.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pazatto will make best efforts to provide alerts via SMS/e-mail/push notifications and it shall be

                        Platform or availing any Pazatto Services. Pazatto shall not be under any obligation to confirm the
                        authenticity of the person(s) receiving the alert. You cannot hold Pazatto liable for
                        non-availability of the SMS/email alert/push notifications service in any manner whatsoever.
                    </li>
                    <li>The SMS/e-mail alert/push notification service provided by Pazatto is an additional facility
                        provided for Your convenience and that it may be susceptible to error, omission and/or
                        inaccuracy. In the event that You observe any error in the information provided in the alert,
                        Pazatto shall be immediately informed about the same by You and Pazatto will make best possible
                        efforts to rectify the error as early as possible. You shall not hold Pazatto liable for any loss,
                        damages, claim, expense including legal cost that may be incurred/suffered by You on account of
                        the SMS/e-mail alert/push notification facility.
                    </li>
                    <li>The clarity, readability, accuracy and promptness of providing the SMS/e-mail alert/push
                        notification service depend on many factors including the infrastructure and connectivity of the
                        service provider. Pazatto shall not be responsible for any non-delivery, delayed delivery or
                        distortion of the alert in any way whatsoever.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will indemnify and hold harmless Pazatto and the SMS/e-mail service provider including its
                        officials from any damages, claims, demands, proceedings, losses, costs, charges and expenses
                        whatsoever including legal charges and attorney’s fees which Pazatto or the SMS/e-mail service
                        provider may at any time incur, sustain, suffer or be subjected to as a consequence of, or

                <h3>Limitation of Liability and Damages</h3>
                In no event, Pazatto or its contractors, agents, licensors, partners or suppliers will be liable to You
                for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages
                (including without limitation lost business opportunities, lost revenues, or loss of anticipated profits
                or any other pecuniary or non-pecuniary loss or damage of any nature whatsoever) arising out of or
                relating to: (i) this Agreement; (ii) the SSOID Agreement; (iii) the Pazatto Services, the Pazatto Platform
                or any reference site/app/platform/service; or (iv) Your use or inability to use the Pazatto Services, the
                Pazatto Platform (including any and all materials) or any reference sites/app/platform/service, even if
                Pazatto or a Pazatto authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no
                event, Pazatto or any of its contractors, directors, employees, agents, third party partners, licensors or
                suppliers will be liable to You for any damages, liabilities, losses, and causes of action arising out
                of or relating to: (i) this Agreement; (ii) the SSOID Agreement; (iii) the Pazatto Services, the Pazatto
                Platform or any reference site/app/platform/service; or (iv) Your use or inability to use the Pazatto
                services, the Pazatto Platform (including any and all materials) or any reference
                sites/app/platform/service; or (v) any other interactions with Pazatto, however caused and whether arising
                in contract, tort including negligence, warranty or otherwise, beyond or in excess of the amount paid by
                You, if any, for using the portion of the Pazatto Service or the Pazatto Platform giving rise to the cause
                of action, or beyond or in excess Rs, 1,000, whichever is less. You acknowledge and agree that Pazatto has
                offered its products and services, set its prices, and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the

                and the limitations of liability set forth herein reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk
                between You and Pazatto, and that the warranty disclaimers and the limitations of liability set forth
                herein form an essential basis of the bargain between You and Pazatto. Pazatto would not be able to provide
                the services to You on an economically reasonable basis without these limitations. Applicable law may
                not completely allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, so
                the above limitations or exclusions will apply to You subject to applicable law. In such cases, Pazatto’s
                liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This paragraph shall
                survive the termination of this Agreement.

                claims, losses, damages, and liabilities, costs and expenses, including without limitation legal fees
                and expenses, arising out of or related to: (i) Your use or misuse of the Pazatto Services or of the Pazatto

                representations, warranties, and covenants made by You herein. Pazatto reserves the right, at Your
                expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which You are required to
                indemnify Pazatto, including rights to settle, and You agree to cooperate with Pazatto’s defense and
                settlement of these claims. Pazatto will use reasonable efforts to notify You of any claim, action, or
                proceeding brought by a third party that is subject to the foregoing indemnification upon becoming aware
                of it. This paragraph shall survive termination of this Agreement.

                of such Telcos. Pazatto is not a warrantor, insurer, or guarantor of the services to be provided by the

                breach of contract by the Telcos. Any disputes regarding the quality, minutes provided, cost,
                expiration, or other terms of the mobile prepaid recharge purchased must be handled directly between You
                (or the recipient of the recharge) and the Telco. The terms and conditions set out in this section are

                Platform, money has been charged to Your card or bank account and a recharge is not delivered within 24

                used in respect of making payments to a biller. The type and range of payment accounts that can be used
                for making payments may differ for each biller depending on biller specifications. There may be
                additional fees/charge when using certain types of payment accounts in respect of a biller. The terms
                upon which a payment can be made to a biller can differ depending on whether a card or a bank account is
                used to issue the payment instruction. Further, depending on the specific facilities allowed by a Pazatto
                business partner, payments to a biller can be made either (a) by issuing a payment instruction for an
                online debit/charge to a payment account or (b) by scheduling an automated debit to a payment account.

                            <li>Cancellation Policy: Passengers are expected to read the ticket cancellation policy
                                carefully. Tickets will be cancelled as per the cancellation policy linked with the

                                cancellation.

                                calculate the refund amount when a ticket is cancelled.
